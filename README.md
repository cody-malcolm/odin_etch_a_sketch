# Etch-a-Sketch

## Objective

To create a virtual "Etch-a-sketch" where when the user passes the mouse through a div, the div gets colored and remains colored until the grid is reset.

## Project Overview

As with the previous projects, I've [done this one before](https://github.com/codyMalcolm/odin-etch-a-sketch). I was unsure if I would benefit from redoing it, however, I reviewed some other student solutions and was inspired to make it a little more user-friendly with an eraser and brush toggle.

#### Specifications

##### Main

1. Project should utilize Git and GitHub.
2. The webpage should be initialized with a 16x16 square grid of divs, created in Javascript.
3. Divs should change color on mouseover, and remain changed.
4. There should be a button at the top of the screen to clear the current grid and prompt the user for the number of squares per side in a new grid. New grids should occupy the same total space, even if the number of squares is different.

##### Recommended

1. The grid of divs should go in a container.

##### Additions

1. Add setting to change squares to random colors.
2. Add setting to change squares to a selected color.
3. For all three color settings, implement a toggle where the color requires multiple passes to fully saturate.
4. Allow initialisation of the grid to a selected color.
5. Implement mouse toggles for drawing, erasing, and neither.

#### Learning Objectives

To demonstrate mastery of manipulating DOM elements with Javascript.

## Author's Notes

#### Preliminary Thoughts

Between the sliders, buttons, toggles, and main grid, this should be a thorough refresher on DOM event handling.
